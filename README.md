# CalculatorParser

The purpose of this program is to convert String inputs in to ints and doubles with the use of regular expressions. 
Without using ints or doubles as arguments, the goal of this program is to parse a String input and attain the exponent value of the String.


The valid strings include:

-Numbers surrounded by commas ():  

(2^3)

-Numbers not surrounded by commas: 

2^3

-Decimal numbers:

2.3^3.3

2^3.2

2.2^3


This was inspired by a previous calculator project I had programmed with PHP a few months prior.


I was inspired to solve the same problem with Java using regular expressions.
