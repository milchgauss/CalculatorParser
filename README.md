# CalculatorParser
Converting String inputs in to recognizable ints and doubles with the use of regular expressions. 
Without using ints or doubles as arguments, the goal of this program is to parse 2 String inputs and attain the exponent value of the two.

This was inspired by a previous calculator project I had programmed with PHP a few months prior.


The regular expression to parse a String input in my calculator project did not work, and so I was inspired 
to solve the same problem with Java using regular expressions.
